1.  Introduction

   BGP Large Communities [RFC8092] provide a mechanism to signal opaque
   information between Autonomous Systems.  This document presents a set
   of examples of how Large BGP Communities could be utilised by an
   operator to achieve various goals.  This document draws from
   experience in Operational Communities such as NANOG [1] and NLNOG
   [2].

2.  The Generic Design Pattern

   Large BGP Communities are composed of three 4-octet fields.  The
   first is the Global Administrator field, whose value is the
   Autonomous System (ASN) that has defined the meaning of the remaining



Snijders, et al.         Expires August 24, 2017                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities        February 2017


   two 4-octet fields, the Local Data fields.  This document describes
   an approach defining these fields as "ASN:Function:Parameter".

   In contemporary deployments of both BGP Communities [RFC1997] and BGP
   Large Communities, functionality can be divided into two categories:

   o  Informational Communities

   o  Action Communities

   Throughout the document a topology of four Autonomous Systems is used
   to illustrate the usage of Communities in the following
   configuration:

           AS 65551
               |
               ^
               |
           AS 64497
             /  \
            ^    \
           /      ^
      AS 64498     \
          |        |
          `<->- AS 64499

   AS 64497 obtains transit services from AS 65551, a 32-bit ASN.  AS
   64497 provides transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499.  AS
   64498 and AS 64499 maintain a peering relationship in which they only
   exchange their customer routes.

   The opaque nature of BGP Large Communities allows for rapid
   deployment of new features or changes to products.  Operators are
   encouraged to publicly publish and maintain documentation of the
   purpose of each Large BGP Community, both informational and action,
   that they support or are visible in looking glasses.

2.1.  Informational Communities

   Informational Communites are labels for attributes such as the origin
   of the route announcement, the nature of the relation with the EBGP
   neighbor or the intended propagation audience.  Informational
   Communities can also assist in providing valuable information for
   day-to-day network operations such as debugging or capacity planning.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which marks the
   routes with the Informational Communities.  For example, AS 64497
   might add a community with the GA 64497 to a route accepted from an



Snijders, et al.         Expires August 24, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities        February 2017


   IBGP or EBGP neighbor as a means of signalling that it was imported
   in a certain geographical region.

   In general, the intended audiences of Informational Communities are
   downstream networks and the Global Administrator itself, but any
   Autonomous System could benefit from receiving these communities.

2.2.  Action Communities

   Action Communities are added as a label to request non-default
   treatment of a route by having the operator's defined routing policy
   adjust variables such as its propagation characteristics, the
   LOCAL_PREFENCE, the next-hop, or the number of AS_PATH prepends to be
   added when exporting or importing a route to/from another AS.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which has defined
   the functionality of that Large Community and is therefore expected
   to perform the action.  For instance, AS 64499 might label a route
   with a Large Community containing GA 64497 to signal AS 64497 a
   request to perform a pre-defined action upon that route.

   In general, the intended audiences of Action Communities are upstream
   providers and the Global Administrator itself, but in theory any AS
   could act as the audience if they are willing to do so.

3.  Examples of Informational Communities

3.1.  Location

   AS 64497 may inform other networks about the geographical region
   where AS 64497 imported a route by marking it with BGP Large
   Communities following one of the following schemes or a combination
   thereof.

3.1.1.  An ISO 3166-1 numeric function

   AS 64497 could assign a value of 1 to the first Local Data field to
   designate the content of the second Local Data field as an ISO-3166-1
   numeric country identifier.

   published by the United Nations Statistics Division [3] for macro
   geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, or

   As part of a commercial agreement between AS 64497 and AS 64498, AS
   64497 might expose BGP traffic engineering features to AS 64498.  One
   such BGP traffic engineering feature could be selectively not
   exporting routes learned from AS 64498 to certain EBGP neighbors of
   AS 64497.

4.1.1.  Peer ASN Based Selective NO_EXPORT

                    Table 7: Action: Prepend in Region

4.3.  Location Based Manipulation of LOCAL_PREF

   It may be desirable for an Autonomous System to allow adjacent
   Autonomous Systems to directly influence the degree of preference
   associated with a route, usually expressed within the LOCAL_PREF
   attribute.

   Furthermore, in the case of large networks spanning significant
   geography, it is often also useful to be able to extend this
   capability and scope its effect to a geographic region.  This is a
   more powerful mechanism than AS_PATH prepending, but since degree of
   preference determines BGP route selection and thus onward
   advertisement, it can also be self-limiting in its scope.

   Since the LOCAL_PREF attribute which influences degree of preference
   is locally significant within each autonomous system, it is not
   usually practical or useful to compare LOCAL_PREF attribute values
   between autonomous systems.  Instead it can be useful to classify the
   major types of route likely to exist within an autonomous system's
   routing hierarchy and provide an ability to set one's route to that
   preference:

   o  A qualified customer route.  Usually the highest preference.

   o  A peer, or network-share, route.  A co-operating network provider
      engaged in a partnership for customer coverage ("peering").

   o  A last resort, or backup route.

   It is entirely possible that some providers may have more classes of
   route preference but it is possible to codify both the route
   preference class and the regional scope within the Local Data fields
   of the Large Community attribute.

   For example, AS64497 might establish the following function
   identifiers to set route preference class, which could allow pairing
   with a location or peer-based operand to determine scope.

       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | Function | Preference Class                              |
       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       |    10    | Qualified customer route. Highest preference. |
       |    15    | Peering partner. Medium preference.           |

             Table 8: Action: Preference Function Identifiers

   Once established, these route preference setting functions can be
   linked with a scoping operand such as per-peer or per-location based
   identifiers in order to provide AS64497's customers with a
   comprehensive and rich toolset to influence route preference.

             Table 9: Action: Regional Preference Communities

   Since the degree of preference influences BGP best path selection
   (which in turn influences onward route propagation) Operators should
   take special care with a traffic engineering tool such as location
   based local preference influence (BGP Wedgies [RFC4264]).

5.  Security Considerations

   Network operators should note the recommendations in Section 11 of
   BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].
