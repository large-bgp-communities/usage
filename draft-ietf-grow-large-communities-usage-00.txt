1.  Introduction

   Large BGP Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community] provide a
   mechanism to signal opaque information between Autonomous Systems.
   This document presents a set of examples on how Large BGP Communities
   could be implemented by an operator to achieve various goals.  This
   document draws from experience in Operational Communities such as
   NANOG [1] and NLNOG [2].

   The opaque nature of Large BGP Communities allows for rapid
   deployment of new features or changes to the product.  Operators are
   encouraged to publicly publish an up to date version of their routing
   policy in which they document what each Large BGP Community means.

Internet-Draft       Usage of Large BGP Communities        December 2016


2.  The Generic Design Pattern

   Large BGP Communities are composed of a 4-octet Global Administrator
   field followed by two 4-octet Local Data fields.  The design pattern
   described in this document uses a "ASN:Function:Parameter"-approach
   to fill the three fields.

   In deployments of both BGP Communities [RFC1997] and Large BGP
   Communities, two categories of Communities are recognised:

   o  Informational Communities

   o  Action Communities

   For each context ideas are provided regarding the contents of each of
   the three fields in Large BGP Communities.

   Throughout the document a topology of four Autonomous Systems is used
   to illustrate the usage of Communities in the following
   configuration:

           AS 65551
               |
               ^
               |
           AS 64497
             /  \
            ^    \
           /      ^
      AS 64498     \
          |        |
          `<->- AS 64499

   AS 64497 obtains transit services from AS 65551.  AS 64497 provides
   transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499.  AS 64498 and AS
   64499 maintain a peering relation in which they only exchange their
   customer routes.

2.1.  Informational Communities

   Informational Communites serve as markers regarding the origin of the
   route announcement, the relation with the EBGP neighbor or for
   instance the intended propagation audience.  Informational
   Communities also assist in network operations such as debugging.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is marking the
   routes with the Informational Communities.  As an example: on a route
   which AS 64497 announces to AS 64498, AS 64497 might add the Large

   BGP Community 64497:100:31 to signal to AS 64498 that the route was
   learned in the Netherlands.

   In general the intended audience of Informational Communities are
   downstream networks, but any adjacent Autonomous System could benefit
   from receiving these communities.

2.2.  Action Communities

   Action Communities are attached to routes to request non-default
   behaviour in an adjacent Autonomous System.  For instance, Action
   Communities are used to change the route's propagation
   characteristics, the route's LOCAL_PREF value or the amount of
   AS_PATH prepends that should be added when exporting or importing a
   route.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is expected to
   perform a non-default action upon receiving the route.  For instance,
   if AS 64499 would want to request AS 64497 to lower the
   LOCAL_PREFERENCE below the default, AS 64499 could tag the route with
   64497:20:50.

   In general the intended audience of Action Communities is an upstream
   provider.

3.  Examples of Informational Communities

3.1.  Location

   AS 64497 can inform its downstream networks about the geographical
   entity where AS 64497 learned a route by marking the route with Large
   BGP Communities following one or a combination of the following
   schemes.

3.1.1.  An ISO 3166-1 numeric function

   AS 64497 could assign a value of 1 to the first Local Data field to
   designate the function of the parameter in the second Local Data
   field as ISO-3166-1 numeric country identifiers.
