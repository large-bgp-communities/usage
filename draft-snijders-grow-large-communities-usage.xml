                provide a mechanism to signal opaque information between
                Autonomous Systems. This document presents a set of examples on
                how Large BGP Communities could be implemented by an operator
                to achieve various goals. This document draws from experience
                in Operational Communities such as <eref target="http://nanog.net">NANOG</eref>
                and <eref target="http://nlnog.net">NLNOG</eref>.
            </t>
            <t>
                The opaque nature of Large BGP Communities allows for rapid
                deployment of new features or changes to the product. Operators
                are encouraged to publicly publish an up to date version of
                their routing policy in which they document what each Large BGP
                Community means.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="The Generic Design Pattern">
            <t>
                Large BGP Communities are composed of a 4-octet Global
                Administrator field followed by two 4-octet Local Data fields.
                The design pattern described in this document uses a
                "ASN:Function:Parameter"-approach to fill the three fields.
            </t>
            <t>
                In deployments of both BGP Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>
                and Large BGP Communities, two categories of Communities are
                recognised:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Informational Communities</t>
                    <t>Action Communities</t>
                </list>
                For each context ideas are provided regarding the contents of
                each of the three fields in Large BGP Communities.
            </t>
            <t>
                Throughout the document a topology of four Autonomous Systems
                is used to illustrate the usage of Communities in the following
                configuration:
                <figure align="center"><artwork><![CDATA[
        AS 64496
            |
            ^
            |
        AS 64497
          /  \
         ^    \
        /      ^
   AS 64498     \
       |        | 
       `<->- AS 64499
]]></artwork></figure>
                AS 64497 obtains transit services from AS 64496. AS 64497
                provides transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499. AS
                64498 and AS 64499 maintain a peering relation in which they
                only exchange their customer routes. 
            </t>
            <section title="Informational Communities">
                <t>
                    Informational Communites serve as markers regarding the
                    origin of the route announcement, the relation with the
                    EBGP neighbor or for instance the intended propagation
                    audience. Informational Communities also assist in network
                    operations such as debugging.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is
                    marking the routes with the Informational Communities. As
                    an example: on a route which AS 64497 announces to AS
                    64498, AS 64497 might add the Large BGP Community
                    64497:100:31 to signal to AS 64498 that the route was
                    learned in the Netherlands.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In general the intended audience of Informational
                    Communities are downstream networks, but any adjacent
                    Autonomous System could benefit from receiving these
                    communities.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Action Communities">
                <t>
                    Action Communities are attached to routes to request
                    non-default behaviour in an adjacent Autonomous System. For
                    instance, Action Communities are used to change the route's
                    propagation characteristics, the route's LOCAL_PREF value
                    or the amount of AS_PATH prepends that should be added when
                    exporting or importing a route.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is
                    expected to perform a non-default action upon receiving the
                    route. For instance, if AS 64499 would want to request AS
                    64497 to lower the LOCAL_PREFERENCE below the default, AS
                    64499 could tag the route with 64497:20:50.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In general the intended audience of Action Communities is
                    an upstream provider.
