1.  Introduction

   BGP Large Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community] provide a
   mechanism to signal opaque information between Autonomous Systems.
   This document presents a set of examples on how BGP Large Communities
   could be implemented by an operator to achieve various goals.  This
   document draws from experience in Operational Communities such as
   NANOG [1] and NLNOG [2].

   The opaque nature of BGP Large Communities allows for rapid
   deployment of new features or changes to the product.  Operators are
   encouraged to publicly publish an up to date version of their routing
   policy in which they document what each BGP Large Community means.

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities         January 2017


2.  The Generic Design Pattern

   BGP Large Communities are composed of a 4-octet Global Administrator
   field followed by two 4-octet Local Data fields.  The design pattern
   described in this document uses a "ASN:Function:Parameter"-approach
   to fill the three fields.

   In deployments of both BGP Communities [RFC1997] and BGP Large
   Communities, two categories of Communities are recognised:

   o  Informational Communities

   o  Action Communities

   For each context ideas are provided regarding the contents of each of
   the three fields in BGP Large Communities.

   Throughout the document a topology of four Autonomous Systems is used
   to illustrate the usage of Communities in the following
   configuration:

           AS 65551
               |
               ^
               |
           AS 64497
             /  \
            ^    \
           /      ^
      AS 64498     \
          |        |
          `<->- AS 64499

   AS 64497 obtains transit services from AS 65551.  AS 64497 provides
   transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499.  AS 64498 and AS
   64499 maintain a peering relation in which they only exchange their
   customer routes.

2.1.  Informational Communities

   Informational Communites serve as markers regarding the origin of the
   route announcement, the relation with the EBGP neighbor or for
   instance the intended propagation audience.  Informational
   Communities also assist in network operations such as debugging.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is marking the
   routes with the Informational Communities.  As an example: on a route
   which AS 64497 announces to AS 64498, AS 64497 might add the BGP

   Large Community 64497:100:31 to signal to AS 64498 that the route was
   learned in the Netherlands.

   In general the intended audience of Informational Communities are
   downstream networks, but any adjacent Autonomous System could benefit
   from receiving these communities.

2.2.  Action Communities

   Action Communities are attached to routes to request non-default
   behaviour in an adjacent Autonomous System.  For instance, Action
   Communities are used to change the route's propagation
   characteristics, the route's LOCAL_PREF value or the amount of
   AS_PATH prepends that should be added when exporting or importing a
   route.

   The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which is expected to
   perform a non-default action upon receiving the route.  For instance,
   if AS 64499 would want to request AS 64497 to lower the
   LOCAL_PREFERENCE below the default, AS 64499 could tag the route with
   64497:20:50.

   In general the intended audience of Action Communities is an upstream
   provider.

3.  Examples of Informational Communities

3.1.  Location

   AS 64497 can inform its downstream networks about the geographical
   entity where AS 64497 learned a route by marking the route with BGP
   Large Communities following one or a combination of the following
   schemes.

3.1.1.  An ISO 3166-1 numeric function

   AS 64497 could assign a value of 1 to the first Local Data field to
   designate the function of the parameter in the second Local Data
   field as ISO-3166-1 numeric country identifiers.

4.3.  Location based manipulation of LOCAL_PREF

   In some cases, it can be desirable for an autonomous system to allow
   adjacent Autonomous Systems to directly influence the degree of
   preference associated with a route, usually expressed within the
   LOCAL_PREF attribute.

   Furthermore, in the case of large networks spanning significant
   geography, it is often also useful to be able to extend this



Snijders & Schmidt        Expires July 26, 2017                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Usage of BGP Large Communities         January 2017


   capability and scope its effect to a geographic region.  This is a
   more powerful mechanism than AS_PATH prepending, but since degree of
   preference determines BGP route selection and thus onward
   advertisement, it can also be self-limiting in its scope.

   Since the LOCAL_PREF attribute which influences degree of preference
   is locally significant within each autonomous system, it is not
   usually practical or useful to compare LOCAL_PREF attribute values
   between autonomous systems.  Instead it can be useful to classify the
   major types of route likely to exist within an autonomous system's
   routing hierarchy and provide an ability to set one's route to that
   preference:

   o  A qualified customer route.  Usually the highest preference.

   o  A peer, or network-share, route.  A co-operating network provider
      engaged in a partnership for customer coverage ("peering").

   o  A last resort, or backup route.

   It is entirely possible that some providers may have more classes of
   route preference but it is possible to codify both the route
   preference class and the regional scope within the Local Data fields
   of the Large Community attribute.

   For example, AS64497 might establish the following function
   identifiers to set route preference class, which could allow pairing
   with a location or peer-based operand to determine scope.

       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | Function | Preference Class                              |
       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       |    10    | Qualified customer route. Highest preference. |
       |    15    | Peering partner. Median preference.           |
       |    19    | Route of last resort. Lowest preference.      |
       +----------+-----------------------------------------------+

             Table 8: Action: Preference Function Identifiers

   Once established, these route preference setting functions can be
   linked with a scoping operand such as per-peer or per-location based
   identifiers in order to provide AS64497's customers with a
   comprehensive and rich toolset to influence route preference.

             Table 9: Action: Regional Preference Communities

   Since the degree of preference influences BGP best path selection
   (which in turn influences onward route propagation) Operators should
   take special care with a traffic engineering tool such as location
   based local preference influence (BGP Wedgies [RFC4264]).

5.  Security Considerations

   Network operators should note the recommendations in Section 11 of
   BGP Operations and Security [RFC7454].

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
