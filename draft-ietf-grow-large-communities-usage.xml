                <xref target="RFC8092">BGP Large Communities</xref> provide a mechanism to signal opaque information between Autonomous Systems (ASs).
                This document presents examples of how operators might utilise BGP Large Communities to achieve various goals.
                This document draws on the experience of operator communities such as <eref target="https://www.nanog.org">NANOG</eref> and <eref target="https://nlnog.net">NLNOG</eref>.

        <section title="The Design Overview">
            <t>
                BGP Large Communities are composed of three 4-octet fields.
                The first is the Global Administrator (GA) field, whose value is the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the AS that has defined the meaning of the remaining two 4-octet fields, known as "Local Data Part 1" and "Local Data Part 2".
                This document describes an approach where the "Local Data Part 1" field contains a function identifier and the "Local Data Part 2" contains a parameter value.
                Using the canonical notation this format can be summarized as "ASN:Function:Parameter".

</texttable>
            <t>
                In contemporary deployments of both BGP Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/> and BGP Large Communities, the function of a community can be divided into two categories:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Informational Communities</t>
                    <t>Action Communities</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Throughout the document a topology of four ASs is used to illustrate the usage of communities in the following configuration:
<figure align="center"><artwork><![CDATA[
        AS 65551
            |
            ^
            |
        AS 64497
          /  \
         ^    \
        /      ^
   AS 64498     \
       |        | 
       `<->- AS 64499
]]></artwork></figure>
                AS 64497 obtains transit services from (is a customer of) AS 65551, a 4-octet ASN.
                AS 64497 provides transit services to both AS 64498 and AS 64499.
                AS 64498 and AS 64499 maintain a peering relationship in which they only exchange their customer routes.
            </t>
            <t>
                The opaque nature of BGP Large Communities allows for rapid deployment of new features or changes to routing polices that perform an action.
                Operators are encouraged to publicly publish and maintain documentation on the purpose of each BGP Large Community, both informational and action, that they support or are visible in BGP RIBs.
            </t>
            <section title="Informational Communities">
                <t>
                    Informational Communities are labels for attributes such as the origin of the route announcement, the nature of the relation with an EBGP neighbor or the intended propagation audience.
                    Informational Communities can also assist in providing valuable information for day-to-day network operations such as debugging or capacity planning.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which labels the routes with the Informational Communities.
                    For example, AS 64497 might add a community with the GA 64497 to a route accepted from an IBGP or EBGP neighbor as a means of signaling that it was imported in a certain geographical region.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In general, the intended audiences of Informational Communities are downstream networks and the Global Administrator itself, but any AS could benefit from receiving these communities.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section title="Action Communities">
                <t>
                    Action Communities are added as a label to request that a route be treated in a particular way within an AS.
                    The operator of the AS defines a routing policy that adjusts path attributes based on the community.  For example, the route's propagation characteristics, the LOCAL_PREF (local preference), the next-hop, or the number of AS_PATH prepends to be added when it is received or propagated can be changed.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Global Administrator field is set to the ASN which has defined the functionality of that BGP Large Community and is the ASN that is expected to perform the action.
                    For example, AS 64499 might label a route with a BGP Large Community containing GA 64497 to request that AS 64497 perform a pre-defined action on that route.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In general, the intended audience of Action Communities are transit providers taking action on behalf of a customer or the Global Administrator itself, but any AS could take action if they choose and any AS could add an Action Community with the GA of a non-adjacent ASN.
                    However, note that an Action Community could also be informational.
                    Its presence is an indicator that the GA may have performed the action and that an AS in the AS_PATH requested it.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Operators are recommended to publish the relative order in which Action Communities (both BGP Communities and BGP Large Communities) are processed in their routing policies.

                <t>
                    As part of an agreement between AS 64497 and AS 64498, AS 64497 might expose BGP traffic engineering functions to AS 64498.
                    One such BGP traffic engineering function might allow AS 64498 to manipulate the value of the LOCAL_PREF attribute of routes learned from AS 64498 within AS 64497, even though the LOCAL_PREF attribute is non-transitive and is not propagated to EBGP neighbors.

                <t>
                    The LOCAL_PREF value of routes are locally significant within each AS and are impossible to list in this document.
                    Instead, the typical LOCAL_PREF values could be classified as a hierarchy and a BGP Large Community function exposed allowing an EBGP neighbor to affect the LOCAL_PREF value within the specified GA.
                    The following example list defines the classes of routes in the order of descending LOCAL_PREF value and assigns a function identifier which could be used in the Function field of a BGP Large Community.

                    The LOCAL_PREF attribute strongly influences the BGP Decision Process, which in turn affects the scope of route propagation.
                    Operators should take special care when using Action Communities that decrease the LOCAL_PREF value, and the degree of preference, to a value below that of another route class.
                    Some of the unintended BGP states that might arise as a result of these traffic engineering decisions are described as "BGP Wedgies" in <xref target="RFC4264"/>.

                <t>
                    Route Servers <xref target="RFC7947"/> use BGP to broker network reachability information among their clients.
                    As not all route server clients may wish to interconnect with each other, the route server operator will usually implement a mechanism to allow each client to control the route server's export routing policies, as described in Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7948"/>.
                    One widely-used mechanism is a route server specific adaption of <xref target="selective_noexport">"ASN Based Selective NO_EXPORT"</xref>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    An example BGP Large Communities policy which enables client-controlled prefix distribution for a route server operating as AS 64497, is outlined as follows:

                    <c>64497:0:0</c><c>Do not announce route to any peers by default</c>
                    <c>64497:1:0</c><c>Announce route to all peers by default</c>

                <t>
                    Multiple BGP Large Community values can be used together to implement fine-grained route distribution control.
                    For example, route server client AS 64500 might wish to use a route server for interconnecting to all other clients except AS 64510.
                    In this case, they would label all their outbound routes to the route server with 64497:1:0 (to announce to all clients by default) and 64497:1:64510 (to prevent announcement to AS 64510).
                </t>
                <t>
                    Alternatively, route server client AS 64501 may have a selective routing policy and may wish to interconnect with only AS 64505 and AS 64506.
                    This could be implemented by announcing routes labeled with 64497:0:0 (blocking all distribution by default) and 64497:1:64505, 64497:1:64506 to instruct the route server to force announcement to those two ASNs.
