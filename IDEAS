Suggested types of communities:

1. Informational, per-ASN and location-specific
2. Per-ASN prepending and no-export
2a. Traditional, with global effect
2b. Regional, with non-global effect
3. Remotely-triggered blackholing
3a. Traditional, with global effect
3b. Selective, with non-global effect
3b i. Radius around origin of the prefix
3b ii. Specific routers within provider's network
4. LocalPref manipulation
4a. Active/Passive uplink signalling
4b. Location-specific signalling

1. Traditionally used AS:CTLLL format within AS49544 where:

AS	IANA-allocated ASN
C	Continent where the route was learned.
T	Type of relationship with BGP neighbor.
LLL	Location where the route was learned.

Trouble with this situation is that one can not distinguish between routes
learned on different IX'es in the same city. Consider LINX LON1, LINX LON2, and
LONAP: all are public peering locations in London. Two new formats may be
considered here; Actor:Peer:Location for private relations and
Actor:RS-ASN:Location for public relations. Allows one to distinguish between
let's say LINX and LONAP since RS ASN's are different, also allows one to
distinguish between LINX LON and LINX NoVA, but doesn't tackle the difference
between two IX LANs operated by the same entity within one city (e.g. LINX
LON1/LON2, Netnod Stockholm A/B). Same goes for redundant private connections.
Use a bit in the location field, or simply don't care?

Location - previously limited to 3 bits (4 if we include continent). Some
operators like NTT, Level3, etc used arbitrary values in this field. i3D.net
chose to go with a mixture of various standards that happened to fit in our 3
bits:


* North America:
* First location digit indicates federal nation:
* 1 United States of America
* 2 Canada

* For USA, the second and third location digits indicate State ANSI FIPS code:
* http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi_statetables.html
* For Canada, the second and third location digits indicate Canada's SGC
* Provinces and Territories code:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Geographical_Classification_code_(Canada)#Provinces_and_Territories

* Rest of the world:
* The three location digits are the ITU-T E.164 telephone country code:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes#Alphabetical_listing_by_country_or_region

The new standard provides a significant number of additional bits, would
suggest to pick a single international standard which can encode location at
least down to a city level. Another alternative - geographical coordinates?
Either way, should probably require the user to fill the field up with zero's
to a certain amount of bits to avoid conflicts with action communities which
have shorter codes in the third field to be used for signalling.

=========================

2a. Traditional global-effect prepending and no-export seems like a no-brainer
for private interconnections: actor:target:action

Actor and target should be an IANA-allocated ASN, action can be 1 / 2 / 3 to
specify the amount of prepends or 0 to signal the actor that the prefix
shouldn't be exported to the target.

Challenges for IX'es in this model are:
- If we insert the RS-ASN as target, do we only want to signal towards the
  route-server or to the whole IX? This is ambigious.
- If we have an IX operator with multiple peering LANs around the world using a
  single RS-ASN - such as Equinix - how do we target specific IX cities?
- Format of actor:actor:

2b. Regional-effect prepending and no-export - actor:target remains the same,
third field should change to signify the new desired action. Does this also
tackle our IX dilemma, e.g. should an actor:target:2 tag by default signal two
prepends to all IX'es using that RS-ASN, and rely on the third field?

=========================

3. Blackholes should never be propagated outside the actor's ASN unless one
wants to achieve a blackhole in the upstream's ASN, too.

3a. should there even be a -large version of a simple global blackhole, since
that basic functionality is already covered by draft-ietf-grow-blackholing-03?
See also 3b, where the suggested format is blackhole-asn:type:data - so the
dumb community could be something like 64666:0:666

3b. selective blackholes should never be propagated outside the actor's ASN,
e.g. the one which performs the action. Since we don't want different
communities for different operators, but rather, a standardized method to
accomplish certain actions so end users need to modify as little as possible in
case of emergency, the first field in the Large Community should always be the
same. That opens up the possibility to signal a blackhole action through the
first field of the Large community, reserving the second field for the type of
blackhole (e.g. dumb, selective radius, selective location, selective router,
selective arbitrary value), and the third field for the aforementioned data.

AS666 belongs to an actual network so while it's become somewhat of a de-facto
standard for RFC1997 communities I'd like to refrain from using it in the first
field. Should IANA allocate a special-purpose ASN with a bunch of 6's, or do we
use something like 64666 which falls into RFC6996?

===========================

4. Usually implemented as actor:desired-localpref with RFC1997. Could now be
expanded to actor:location:localpref, where location could also target
"global". We don't need a separate community for active/passive signalling,
that can be tackled with the to-be-determined location tag for "global".
